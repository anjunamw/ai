# LLMCoder Extended Features: Technical Implementation Guide

This document provides a detailed technical overview of the implementation for the extended features of LLMCoder, focusing on practical approaches, API integrations, and code examples.

---

## 1. Email Integration

**Detailed Description:** This feature allows LLMCoder to integrate with the user's email account to learn communication patterns, draft email replies, and provide summaries of email content. The goal is to assist users in managing their email more efficiently.

**Technical Implementation:**

*   **API:** Utilize the email provider's API. For Gmail, this would be the Gmail API. For Outlook/Microsoft 365, the Microsoft Graph API for Mail would be used. These APIs provide functionalities to access emails, send emails (after user review), and manage email metadata.

*   **Authentication:** Implement OAuth 2.0 for secure user authentication and authorization to access their email accounts. This ensures user credentials are not directly stored by LLMCoder and access is granted with user consent.

*   **Data Fetching:** Use API calls to fetch emails periodically.  For Gmail API, `users.messages.list` can be used to retrieve lists of messages, and `users.messages.get` to fetch full email content. For Microsoft Graph API, `/me/messages` endpoint can be used.

    ```python
    # Example Python code snippet using Gmail API (assuming google-api-python-client library)
    from googleapiclient.discovery import build

    # ... (service = build('gmail', 'v1', credentials=creds)) ...

    def list_emails(service, user_id='me', query='is:inbox'):
        results = service.users().messages().list(userId=user_id, q=query).execute()
        messages = results.get('messages', [])
        return messages

    def get_email(service, user_id='me', msg_id='message_id'):
        message = service.users().messages().get(userId=user_id, id=msg_id, format='full').execute()
        return message

    emails = list_emails(service)
    if emails:
        for email in emails:
            message = get_email(service, msg_id=email['id'])
            # Process email content (message['payload'])
            print(f"Subject: {message['payload']['headers'][0]['value']}") # Example: Subject line
    ```

*   **Learning Communication Style:**
    *   **Data Storage:** Store processed emails in a local database. Consider using a document database like MongoDB or a relational database like PostgreSQL.
    *   **NLP Processing:**  Use NLP libraries like `spaCy` or `NLTK` to process email content.
        *   **Sentiment Analysis:** Determine the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of emails and user responses.
        *   **Topic Modeling:** Identify common topics in emails using techniques like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) or Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF).
        *   **Style Analysis:** Analyze sentence structure, word choice, and tone of user's manually sent emails to learn their writing style.

*   **Drafting Email Replies:**
    *   **LLM Integration:** Utilize a fine-tuned LLM (as discussed in LLMCoder overview) or a general-purpose LLM like GPT-3.5 Turbo via API (e.g., OpenAI API).
    *   **Contextual Input:**  Provide the LLM with the incoming email content, learned communication style, and potentially the thread history as context.
    *   **Prompt Engineering:** Design effective prompts to instruct the LLM to draft a reply that is contextually relevant and aligns with the user's learned style.

    ```python
    # Example Python using OpenAI API (assuming openai library)
    import openai

    # openai.api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY' # Securely manage API key

    def draft_reply(email_content, user_style_summary):
        prompt = f"""
        Draft an email reply to the following email, considering the user's communication style:

        User Style Summary: {user_style_summary}

        Email Content:
        {email_content}

        Reply Draft:
        """
        response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
            model="gpt-3.5-turbo", # Or your fine-tuned model
            messages=[
                {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
            ]
        )
        return response.choices[0].message['content']

    # ... (email_content from fetched email, user_style_summary from learned data) ...
    draft = draft_reply(email_content, user_style_summary)
    print("Drafted Reply:\n", draft)
    ```

*   **User Review and Sending:** Display the drafted reply in the web GUI. Allow the user to review, edit, and then manually send the email using the email provider's API (e.g., `users.messages.send` in Gmail API, `/me/sendMail` in Microsoft Graph API).

*   **Continuous Learning:**  When the user manually sends an edited or newly composed email, analyze this email to further refine the learned communication style.

---

## 2. Slack Integration

**Detailed Description:** Similar to email integration, but focused on Slack. LLMCoder will learn Slack communication style, draft replies to Slack messages, and provide summaries of Slack conversations.

**Technical Implementation:**

*   **API:** Slack API (specifically, the `slack_sdk` for Python or similar SDKs for other languages).

*   **Authentication:** Slack OAuth 2.0 flow for secure user authorization.

*   **Data Fetching:** Use Slack API methods like `conversations.history` to fetch message history from channels and direct messages. Use `rtm.connect` or the Events API for real-time message updates.

    ```python
    # Example Python using slack_sdk library
    from slack_sdk import WebClient

    # slack_client = WebClient(token='YOUR_SLACK_BOT_TOKEN') # Securely manage token

    def get_channel_history(slack_client, channel_id, limit=100):
        response = slack_client.conversations_history(
            channel=channel_id,
            limit=limit
        )
        messages = response['messages']
        return messages

    # ... (channel_id = 'C123ABC456') ...
    history = get_channel_history(slack_client, channel_id)
    if history:
        for message in history:
            if 'text' in message:
                print(f"Message: {message['text']}")
    ```

*   **Learning Communication Style (Slack Specifics):**
    *   **Channel Context:**  Analyze communication style within different Slack channels (e.g., `#general`, `#project-team`). Styles might vary based on channel context.
    *   **Emoji Usage:**  Track user's emoji usage patterns in Slack.
    *   **Thread Participation:** Analyze user's participation in Slack threads.

*   **Drafting Slack Replies:**  Similar to email drafting, use an LLM with context from the Slack message, learned Slack communication style, and potentially the thread history.

*   **User Review and Sending (Slack):** Display drafted replies in the web GUI. Allow review, editing, and manual sending via Slack API's `chat.postMessage` method.

*   **Real-time Updates:** Utilize Slack's Events API or RTM API to get real-time message events and trigger drafting suggestions promptly.

---

## 3. Confluence Integration

**Detailed Description:**  LLMCoder will integrate with Confluence to index documentation, answer questions based on Confluence content, and provide contextually relevant information from documentation.

**Technical Implementation:**

*   **API:** Confluence REST API (Atlassian REST API documentation).

*   **Authentication:** Confluence API supports various authentication methods, including Basic Authentication (username/password - less secure, use for testing in controlled environments only), API Tokens (recommended), and OAuth 2.0. API Tokens are generally preferred for server-to-server communication.

*   **Data Fetching and Indexing:**
    *   **Space Crawling:** Use the Confluence API to recursively crawl specified Confluence spaces.  Start with `/wiki/rest/api/space` to list spaces and then `/wiki/rest/api/content` to list content within spaces.
    *   **Content Extraction:** For each Confluence page, use `/wiki/rest/api/content/{id}?expand=body.storage` to retrieve the page content in "storage format" (HTML-like XML).
    *   **Text Extraction:** Use libraries like `BeautifulSoup` to parse the HTML-like "storage format" and extract plain text content from `<p>`, `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<li>`, etc. tags.
    *   **Vector Embeddings:** Generate vector embeddings for each Confluence page's text content using sentence transformers (e.g., `sentence-transformers` Python library). Store these embeddings in a vector database like Chroma, Pinecone, or FAISS. Also, store the page title, URL, and extracted text for each embedding.

    ```python
    # Example Python for fetching Confluence page content and creating embeddings (using confluence-python and sentence-transformers)
    from atlassian import Confluence # confluence-python library
    from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

    # confluence_client = Confluence(url='YOUR_CONFLUENCE_URL', token='YOUR_API_TOKEN') # Use API Token
    # embedding_model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2') # Choose an embedding model

    def index_confluence_space(confluence_client, space_key, embedding_model, vector_db): # vector_db is placeholder for your chosen vector DB interaction
        page_ids = confluence_client.get_space_content_ids(space_key=space_key, content_type='page')
        for page_id in page_ids:
            page_content = confluence_client.get_content_by_id(page_id, expand='body.storage')
            if page_content and 'body' in page_content and 'storage' in page_content['body']:
                html_content = page_content['body']['storage']['value']
                soup = BeautifulSoup(html_content, 'html.parser')
                text_content = soup.get_text(separator=' ', strip=True) # Extract text
                if text_content:
                    embedding = embedding_model.encode(text_content)
                    page_url = f"{confluence_client.url}/wiki/spaces/{space_key}/pages/{page_id}" # Construct page URL
                    vector_db.add(embeddings=[embedding], documents=[text_content], ids=[str(page_id)], metadatas=[{'title': page_content['title'], 'url': page_url}]) # Example vector DB add - adjust to your DB API

    # ... (vector_db setup, confluence_client initialization) ...
    index_confluence_space(confluence_client, 'YOUR_SPACE_KEY', embedding_model, vector_db)
    ```

*   **Question Answering (RAG):**
    *   **User Query Embedding:**  When a user asks a question, generate a vector embedding for the question using the same sentence transformer model.
    *   **Semantic Search:** Use the vector database to perform a similarity search (e.g., cosine similarity) between the query embedding and the Confluence page embeddings. Retrieve the top relevant pages.
    *   **Contextual LLM Query:**  Formulate a prompt for the LLM that includes the user's question and the retrieved Confluence page content as context. Instruct the LLM to answer the question based on the provided context.

    ```python
    def answer_question_confluence(question, vector_db, embedding_model, llm_model): # llm_model is placeholder for your LLM interaction
        query_embedding = embedding_model.encode(question)
        results = vector_db.similarity_search(query_embedding, k=3) # Retrieve top 3 relevant pages
        context_text = "\n\n".join([result.page_content for result in results]) # Combine retrieved page content
        prompt = f"""
        Answer the following question based on the provided Confluence documentation context. If the context does not contain the answer, say "I cannot find the answer in the documentation.":

        Question: {question}

        Confluence Context:
        {context_text}

        Answer:
        """
        response = llm_model.generate_response(prompt) # Placeholder - use your LLM API call here
        return response

    # ... (vector_db setup, embedding_model, llm_model initialization) ...
    user_question = "How do I configure the database connection?"
    answer = answer_question_confluence(user_question, vector_db, embedding_model, llm_model)
    print("Confluence Answer:\n", answer)
    ```

*   **Real-time Assistance (Contextual Help):**  When the user is working in LLMCoder's code editor, analyze the code context (e.g., keywords, function names, library names). Use this context to query the Confluence index and proactively suggest relevant documentation pages or answer common questions related to the code being written.

---

## 4. Code Library Knowledge

**Detailed Description:**  LLMCoder will be provided with documentation and code for specific libraries, SDKs, and APIs. It will then assist users by answering questions about these libraries and providing context-aware code suggestions.

**Technical Implementation:**

*   **Input Processing:**
    *   **Documentation Parsing:** Handle various documentation formats:
        *   **PDF:** Use `PDFMiner` or `PyPDF2` to extract text from PDF documentation.
        *   **HTML:** Use `BeautifulSoup` to parse HTML documentation (from websites or local HTML files).
        *   **Markdown:** Use Markdown parsers (built-in or libraries like `markdown`) to process Markdown files.
        *   **Plain Text:** Handle plain text documentation.
    *   **Code Parsing:** For code examples and library source code:
        *   **Language-Specific Parsers:** Use language-specific parsing libraries (e.g., `ast` for Python, `babel` for JavaScript, `tree-sitter` for more robust parsing across languages). Extract function definitions, class definitions, code comments, and code structure.

*   **Data Storage and Indexing:**
    *   **Documentation Indexing:** Similar to Confluence indexing, generate vector embeddings for documentation text and store them in a vector database. Include metadata like library name, documentation section, etc.
    *   **Code Indexing:**
        *   **Code Embeddings:** Generate vector embeddings for code snippets (function signatures, class definitions, code comments).
        *   **Symbol Table:** Create a symbol table or index to map function names, class names, and other code symbols to their documentation and code examples. This can be a simple key-value store or a more structured database.

*   **Assistance and Question Answering:**
    *   **Context-Aware Suggestions:** In the code editor, when the user types code related to a known library (e.g., using a library function name), LLMCoder can:
        *   **Code Completion:** Suggest function arguments, method calls, etc., based on library API.
        *   **Documentation Tooltips:** Display relevant documentation snippets as tooltips when hovering over library symbols.
        *   **Example Code Snippets:** Provide example code usage for library functions or classes.
    *   **Question Answering (Library Specific):**
        *   **Query Processing:**  When a user asks a question about a library, identify the library context (if specified or inferrable from the question).
        *   **Retrieval:**  Search the documentation and code index for relevant information using semantic search (vector database) and symbol table lookups.
        *   **LLM-Based Answer Generation:**  Use an LLM to generate answers based on retrieved documentation and code snippets, similar to the Confluence question answering approach.

    ```python
    # Example Python - rudimentary code parsing (using ast for Python) and function signature extraction
    import ast

    def extract_function_signatures(code_string):
        tree = ast.parse(code_string)
        signatures = []
        for node in ast.walk(tree):
            if isinstance(node, ast.FunctionDef):
                function_name = node.name
                arguments = [arg.arg for arg in node.args.args] # Simple argument extraction
                signature = f"{function_name}({', '.join(arguments)})"
                signatures.append(signature)
        return signatures

    example_code = """
    def calculate_sum(a, b):
        '''This function calculates the sum of two numbers.'''
        return a + b

    class MyClass:
        def __init__(self, value):
            self.value = value

        def get_value(self):
            return self.value
    """

    signatures = extract_function_signatures(example_code)
    print("Function Signatures:", signatures) # Output: ['calculate_sum(a, b)', 'get_value(self)']
    ```

---

## 5. JIRA Integration

**Detailed Description:** LLMCoder integrates with JIRA to learn ticket workflows, draft responses to tickets, create new tickets, manage ticket tracking, and automate certain JIRA-related tasks.

**Technical Implementation:**

*   **API:** JIRA REST API (Atlassian REST API documentation).  Use a Python library like `jira` or directly use `requests` for HTTP requests.

*   **Authentication:** JIRA API supports API tokens and Basic Authentication. API tokens are recommended for security.

*   **Data Fetching and Learning:**
    *   **Ticket Data:** Use JIRA API endpoints like `/rest/api/3/search` (JQL queries) to fetch JIRA tickets. Define JQL queries to retrieve tickets relevant for learning (e.g., tickets assigned to the user, tickets from specific projects, tickets with certain statuses).
    *   **Workflow Learning:** Analyze fetched tickets to understand:
        *   **Ticket Types:** Common ticket types (Bug, Story, Task, etc.).
        *   **Workflows:** Typical status transitions for different ticket types.
        *   **Resolution Patterns:** Common resolutions and resolution descriptions.
        *   **Comment Styles:** Analyze comments in tickets to learn user's (and team's) communication style in JIRA.
    *   **Data Storage:** Store learned ticket data, workflow patterns, and comment styles in a database.

    ```python
    # Example Python using jira-python library
    from jira import JIRA

    # jira_options = {'server': 'YOUR_JIRA_SERVER_URL'}
    # jira_client = JIRA(options=jira_options, token_auth=('YOUR_JIRA_API_TOKEN')) # Use API Token

    def fetch_jira_tickets(jira_client, jql_query, limit=100):
        issues = jira_client.search_issues(jql_query, maxResults=limit)
        return issues

    # Example JQL query to get recently updated tickets assigned to the current user
    jql = 'assignee = currentUser() ORDER BY updated DESC'
    tickets = fetch_jira_tickets(jira_client, jql)
    if tickets:
        for issue in tickets:
            print(f"Ticket Key: {issue.key}, Summary: {issue.fields.summary}, Status: {issue.fields.status.name}")
    ```

*   **Drafting Ticket Responses:**
    *   **Contextual Input:** When a new JIRA ticket or a ticket update notification arrives, provide the ticket description, comments, and learned ticket patterns to the LLM.
    *   **Response Generation:** Prompt the LLM to draft a response to the ticket, considering the context and learned communication style in JIRA.

*   **Ticket Creation:**
    *   **User Input:**  Via the web GUI or voice, the user initiates ticket creation.
    *   **Information Gathering:** LLMCoder guides the user to provide necessary information:
        *   **Project:** Project to create the ticket in.
        *   **Issue Type:** (Story, Bug, Task, etc.)
        *   **Summary:** Ticket summary.
        *   **Description:** Detailed description.
        *   **Priority:** Priority level.
        *   **Story Points (Optional):** For Story type tickets.
    *   **API Call for Ticket Creation:** Use JIRA API's `/rest/api/3/issue` endpoint to create the ticket with the collected information.

    ```python
    def create_jira_ticket(jira_client, project_key, issue_type_name, summary, description, priority_name=None, story_points=None):
        issue_dict = {
            'project': {'key': project_key},
            'issuetype': {'name': issue_type_name},
            'summary': summary,
            'description': description,
        }
        if priority_name:
            issue_dict['priority'] = {'name': priority_name}
        if story_points:
            issue_dict['fields'] = {'customfield_XXXXX': story_points} # Replace XXXXX with actual story points custom field ID

        new_issue = jira_client.create_issue(fields=issue_dict)
        return new_issue

    # ... (jira_client initialization, user input collected) ...
    new_ticket = create_jira_ticket(jira_client, 'PROJECTKEY', 'Story', 'Implement JIRA Integration', 'Detailed description of JIRA integration feature...', priority_name='High', story_points=5)
    print(f"Created JIRA Ticket: {new_ticket.key}")
    ```

*   **Epic and Subtask Generation:**  Based on the ticket type and description, LLMCoder can suggest creating Epics and Subtasks. Use LLM to analyze the ticket description and identify potential Epics and Subtasks. Then, use JIRA API to create them, linking them to the main ticket.

*   **Ticket Tracking:**
    *   **Flagging Tickets:** User can flag tickets in the web GUI to be tracked.
    *   **Monitoring Updates:** Periodically check for updates on tracked tickets using JIRA API (e.g., checking `updated` timestamp or using webhooks if JIRA supports them for real-time updates).
    *   **Notifications:**  Notify the user in the web GUI or via email/Slack if there are updates to tracked tickets (status changes, new comments, etc.).

## 6. Screen/Audio/Key Capture & "Turbo Mode"

**Detailed Description:** LLMCoder will capture screen activity, audio input, and keystrokes to provide real-time assistance during meetings, troubleshooting sessions, and brainstorming. "Turbo Mode" prioritizes real-time processing for immediate contributions in dynamic conversations.

**Technical Implementation:**

*   **Capture Libraries:**
    *   **Screen Capture:**
        *   **Python:** `mss` (fast cross-platform screenshot library), `PyAutoGUI` (for simpler screenshots, but potentially slower). For specific platforms, OS-native APIs can be used for better performance.
        *   **JavaScript (for browser-based capture - limited capabilities):** `getUserMedia` API for screen sharing (requires user permission and browser support).  More complex and resource-intensive for continuous capture.
    *   **Audio Capture:**
        *   **Python:** `pyaudio` (cross-platform audio I/O), `sounddevice` (NumPy-based audio I/O).
        *   **JavaScript (browser):** `getUserMedia` API for microphone access (requires user permission).
    *   **Key Capture:**
        *   **Python:** `keyboard` (cross-platform keyboard hook), `pynput` (more general input monitoring). OS-specific APIs can also be used.
        *   **JavaScript (browser):**  Limited browser-based key capture for security reasons. Can capture events within the browser window, but not system-wide.

*   **Real-time Processing Pipeline:**
    *   **Capture Interval:** Set a capture interval (e.g., 1 frame per second for screen, short audio chunks). Balance real-time responsiveness with computational load.
    *   **Data Streaming:** Stream captured data (screen frames, audio chunks, keystrokes) to the LLM for analysis. WebSockets are a good choice for real-time bidirectional communication between the client (capturing) and server (LLM processing).
    *   **Speech-to-Text (STT):** For audio, use STT services (e.g., Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API, OpenAI Whisper API, or local STT models like `vosk`) to transcribe audio into text.
    *   **LLM Analysis:** Feed the transcribed text (from audio), potentially OCR-extracted text from screen frames (if needed for specific use cases), and keystroke data to the LLM.

*   **Diarization and Summarization (Meetings):**
    *   **Meeting Integration (Preferred):** Integrate with conferencing software APIs (Zoom API, Microsoft Teams API) if possible. These APIs often provide features like:
        *   **AI Summaries:** Some platforms offer built-in AI meeting summaries. Leverage these if available.
        *   **Diarization:**  Speaker diarization (identifying who said what) if provided by the platform.
        *   **Live Transcription:** Live transcription of meetings.
    *   **Local Audio Processing (Fallback):** If direct API integration is not feasible, process recorded audio:
        *   **Diarization Libraries:** Use libraries like `pyannote.audio` or `speechbrain` for speaker diarization.
        *   **Summarization LLMs:** Use LLMs fine-tuned for summarization or general-purpose LLMs to summarize meeting transcripts.

*   **"Turbo Mode":**
    *   **Prioritization:** In "Turbo Mode," prioritize the real-time processing pipeline. Reduce or pause background tasks (like email drafting, JIRA learning) to dedicate resources to real-time analysis.
    *   **Continuous Contribution (No Prompt):**  In "Turbo Mode," the agent actively listens and analyzes the conversation without explicit prompts. It attempts to identify relevant information and contribute to the discussion proactively (to the user only, not to the meeting directly). Contributions could be:
        *   **Contextual Information:**  Providing relevant documentation snippets, code examples, or knowledge base articles based on the conversation topics.
        *   **Troubleshooting Suggestions:** Suggesting potential troubleshooting steps based on discussed errors or problems.
        *   **Brainstorming Ideas:**  Generating related ideas or solutions during brainstorming sessions.

    ```python
    # Example Python - rudimentary screen capture and audio capture loop (using mss and pyaudio)
    import mss
    import pyaudio
    import time

    # Screen capture setup
    sct = mss.mss()
    monitor = sct.monitors[1] # Capture primary monitor

    # Audio capture setup
    CHUNK = 1024
    FORMAT = pyaudio.paInt16
    CHANNELS = 1
    RATE = 44100
    p = pyaudio.PyAudio()
    stream = p.open(format=FORMAT, channels=CHANNELS, rate=RATE, input=True, frames_per_buffer=CHUNK)

    while True: # Capture loop - in a real application, manage this within a thread/process
        # Screen capture
        screenshot = sct.grab(monitor) # Returns image data
        # ... (send screenshot data to LLM or processing pipeline via WebSocket) ...

        # Audio capture
        audio_data = stream.read(CHUNK) # Read audio chunk
        # ... (send audio_data to STT service and then to LLM via WebSocket) ...

        time.sleep(0.1) # Control capture rate (10 FPS in this example)
    ```

---

## 7. Playwright Integration

**Detailed Description:** LLMCoder will use Playwright to automate browser interactions for tasks defined by the user. This allows for task completion during "down hours" or on demand.

**Technical Implementation:**

*   **Playwright Library:** Utilize the Playwright library (Python or Node.js). Playwright provides a high-level API to control browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit) and automate web interactions.

*   **Task Definition and Scheduling:**
    *   **Task Definition Interface:**  Web GUI to allow users to define tasks. Tasks can be described textually (e.g., "Download reports from website X," "Scrape product prices from website Y") or through a more structured interface.
    *   **Task Scheduling:**
        *   **"Down Hours" Scheduling:** User can define "down hours" (e.g., evenings, nights, weekends). Tasks scheduled without specific times will be executed during these hours.
        *   **On-Demand Execution:**  Users can also trigger tasks to run immediately.
        *   **Scheduling Mechanism:** Use a scheduling library (e.g., `schedule` in Python, `node-cron` in Node.js) to manage task execution times.

*   **Task Execution with Playwright:**
    *   **Playwright Script Generation:** For each task, generate a Playwright script (Python or JavaScript). The script will use Playwright API calls to:
        *   **Launch Browser:** Launch a headless or headed browser instance.
        *   **Navigate to URL:** `page.goto('URL')`.
        *   **Interact with Elements:** Use selectors (CSS, XPath) to find and interact with web elements: `page.click('selector')`, `page.type('selector', 'text')`, `page.fill('selector', 'text')`.
        *   **Extract Data:** `page.textContent('selector')`, `page.getAttribute('selector', 'attributeName')`.
        *   **Download Files:** `page.waitForDownload()`.
        *   **Take Screenshots:** `page.screenshot()`.
    *   **Script Execution Environment:**  Run Playwright scripts in a controlled environment. Consider using a process pool or task queue to manage concurrent task executions.
    *   **Error Handling and Logging:** Implement robust error handling in Playwright scripts. Log task execution status, errors, and output.

*   **VM Offloading (Optional):**
    *   **VM Management:** If tasks are resource-intensive or need to run outside "down hours" without impacting the user's primary machine, implement VM offloading.
    *   **VM Providers:** Integrate with cloud VM providers (AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine, Azure VMs) or use local VM management tools (e.g., `libvirt`, VirtualBox CLI).
    *   **Task Offloading Mechanism:** When a task is scheduled for VM execution, provision a VM (if needed), deploy the Playwright script to the VM, execute the script on the VM, and retrieve the results back to the main LLMCoder system.

    ```python
    # Example Python Playwright script (basic website navigation and data extraction)
    from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

    def run_playwright_task():
        with sync_playwright() as p:
            browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=True) # Headless mode for background tasks
            page = browser.new_page()
            page.goto("https://example.com")

            title = page.title()
            print(f"Page Title: {title}")

            paragraph_text = page.locator('p').text_content() # Extract text from <p> element
            print(f"Paragraph Text: {paragraph_text}")

            page.screenshot(path="example.png") # Take screenshot

            browser.close()

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        run_playwright_task()
    ```

## 8. Intelligent Macros

**Detailed Description:** LLMCoder will allow users to create "intelligent macros" by interactively demonstrating tasks. These macros can then be replayed later to automate repetitive actions.

**Technical Implementation:**

*   **Interactive Task Learning (Recording):**
    *   **Voice/Text Interface:**  Web GUI with voice and text input capabilities for task definition.
    *   **Step-by-Step Recording Mode:** When the user initiates macro recording:
        *   **UI Event Capture:** Capture UI events: mouse clicks, mouse movements, keyboard input, window focus changes. Libraries for UI event capture depend on the OS.
            *   **Python:** `pynput` (cross-platform input monitoring). OS-specific APIs might offer more fine-grained control.
            *   **JavaScript (browser - limited scope):**  Event listeners within the browser window. Limited to actions within the browser.
        *   **Element Identification:** When a user clicks on a UI element, identify the element using selectors (CSS, XPath, accessibility attributes). Libraries like `PyAutoGUI` (for Python) can help with screen region identification and basic element interaction, but Playwright is generally more robust for web UI automation. For desktop applications, UI automation libraries specific to the OS (e.g., UI Automation on Windows, Accessibility APIs on macOS) might be needed.
        *   **Action Recording:** Store a sequence of actions. Each action should include:
            *   **Action Type:** (Click, Type, Scroll, Wait, etc.)
            *   **Target Element Selector:** (CSS, XPath, etc.) or screen coordinates if element selection is not possible.
            *   **Input Data:** (Text to type, key presses, etc.)
            *   **Timestamp:** To allow for delays in replay if needed.
        *   **Voice Instructions:** Allow users to verbally describe steps during recording. Transcribe voice instructions using STT and store them as annotations within the macro sequence.

    *   **Task Description via Conversation:**  Guide the user through task definition using a conversational interface (voice or text).
        *   **Clarifying Questions:** Agent asks clarifying questions to understand the task steps and parameters.
        *   **Example: "I have a task" 'Okay, I am ready to learn the task - what is this task?' "This task is to open the daily sales report and download it" 'Okay, can you show me how you open the daily sales report?'** (User demonstrates steps by interacting with the UI. Agent records these interactions).

*   **Macro Storage and Replay:**
    *   **Macro Storage:** Store recorded macro sequences in a structured format (e.g., JSON or YAML). Each macro can be identified by a name and description provided by the user.
    *   **Macro Replay Engine:**
        *   **Action Execution:**  For each action in a macro sequence, execute the corresponding UI automation command:
            *   **Click:** Simulate mouse click at recorded coordinates or using element selectors (Playwright or UI automation library).
            *   **Type:** Simulate keyboard input (Playwright or keyboard automation library).
            *   **Wait:** Introduce delays as recorded in the macro.
        *   **Error Handling:** Implement error handling during macro replay. If an element is not found or an action fails, log the error and provide options for the user (e.g., stop macro, retry action, skip action).
        *   **Visual Feedback:** Provide visual feedback during macro replay (e.g., highlighting elements being interacted with).

    ```python
    # Example Python - simplified macro replay (using Playwright for web automation, assumes macro is a list of actions)
    from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright
    import time

    def replay_macro(macro_actions): # macro_actions is a list of action dictionaries
        with sync_playwright() as p:
            browser = p.chromium.launch() # Headed mode for visual feedback during replay
            page = browser.new_page()

            for action in macro_actions:
                action_type = action['type']
                selector = action.get('selector') # Selector might be optional for some actions
                input_text = action.get('text')

                if action_type == 'goto':
                    page.goto(action['url'])
                elif action_type == 'click':
                    if selector:
                        page.click(selector)
                elif action_type == 'type':
                    if selector and input_text:
                        page.type(selector, input_text)
                elif action_type == 'wait':
                    time.sleep(action['duration']) # Wait for specified duration
                # ... (add other action types) ...

            browser.close()

    # Example macro action list (simplified)
    example_macro = [
        {'type': 'goto', 'url': 'https://example.com'},
        {'type': 'click', 'selector': 'body > div > p > a'}, # Example selector
        {'type': 'wait', 'duration': 2},
        {'type': 'type', 'selector': '#search-input', 'text': 'Playwright automation'}, # Example input
    ]

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        replay_macro(example_macro)
    ```

    *   **Crawler Implementation (using Scrapy or custom logic with `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`):**
        *   **Start URLs:** Begin crawling from the user-provided URL.
        *   **Link Extraction:** Extract links from HTML pages (`<a>` tags) to crawl further pages within the website. Use CSS selectors or XPath to identify links.
        *   **Depth Control:** Control the crawling depth to limit the scope of scraping.
        *   **Content Extraction from Pages:** For each crawled page:
            *   **HTML Parsing:** Use `BeautifulSoup` to parse HTML content.
            *   **Text Extraction:** Extract relevant text content from HTML elements (`<p>`, `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<div>`, `<span>`, etc.). Focus on extracting main content and documentation text, and potentially ignore navigation menus, footers, and ads.
            *   **Metadata Extraction (Optional):** Extract metadata like page title, headings, publication dates (if available).

*   **Data Processing and Storage for RAG:**
    *   **Data Cleaning:** Clean extracted text content:

    *   **Querying Scraped Data:** When a user asks a question, the RAG system will:
        *   Generate a query embedding for the question.
        *   Search the vector database containing scraped website content using semantic similarity search.
        *   Retrieve relevant text snippets from the scraped website.
        *   Use an LLM to generate an answer based on the retrieved context (similar to Confluence RAG).

    ```python
    # Example Python using Scrapy (basic spider example - requires Scrapy project setup)
    import scrapy

    class WebsiteScraperSpider(scrapy.Spider):
        name = 'website_scraper'
        # allowed_domains = ['example.com'] # Consider setting allowed domains based on user input URL
        # start_urls = ['http://example.com/'] # Start URL will be set dynamically

        def __init__(self, start_url='', *args, **kwargs): # Pass start_url as argument
            super(WebsiteScraperSpider, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
            self.start_urls = [start_url]
            self.allowed_domains = [scrapy.utils.urlparse.urlparse(start_url).netloc] # Extract domain from start_url

        def parse(self, response):
            page_url = response.url
            page_title = response.css('title::text').get() # Example: Extract title
            page_content_paragraphs = response.css('p::text').getall() # Example: Extract paragraph text

            yield { # Yield scraped data - Scrapy handles storage/processing
                'url': page_url,
                'title': page_title,
                'content': '\n'.join(page_content_paragraphs), # Combine paragraphs into single string
            }

            # Follow links on the page (example - crawl links within the same domain)
            for link in response.css('a::attr(href)').getall():
                yield response.follow(link, self.parse) # Scrapy handles link following and recursion

    # Example - running Scrapy spider programmatically (requires Scrapy project setup and execution)
    # from scrapy.crawler import CrawlerProcess
    # process = CrawlerProcess()
    # process.crawl(WebsiteScraperSpider, start_url='http://example.com') # Pass start_url
    # process.start() # the script will block here until the crawling is finished
    ```

## 23. Host File Access and Control

**Detailed Description:**  LLMCoder will be granted access to the Ubuntu host file system to perform system-level tasks, including package installation, system updates, file review for RAG and learning, service status checks, and bash command execution. **This feature is considered essential and non-negotiable.**

**Technical Implementation:**

*   **Operating System Interaction Libraries:**
    *   **Python:** `subprocess` (for executing external commands, including bash commands), `os` and `shutil` (for file system operations), `apt` library (for package management on Debian/Ubuntu based systems - more direct API access, potentially safer than direct `apt-get` calls, but might require installation).

*   **Access Control and Command Sanitization:**
    *   **Limited Access Path:** Restrict the agent's file system access to a specific, pre-defined directory or set of directories within the Ubuntu host.  Avoid granting access to the entire file system (`/`).
    *   **Command Whitelisting (Strongly Recommended):**  Instead of allowing arbitrary bash command execution, define a whitelist of allowed commands and operations that the agent can perform. This significantly reduces the attack surface. Examples of whitelisted operations:
        *   Package installation (`apt-get install <package_name>`).
        *   Package updates (`apt-get update`, `apt-get upgrade`).
        *   Service status checks (`systemctl status <service_name>`).
        *   File reading from specified directories (for RAG and learning).
        *   Limited file writing/modification in specific, safe directories (if absolutely necessary and carefully controlled).
    *   **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize all user inputs and parameters passed to system commands to prevent command injection vulnerabilities. Use parameterized commands or shell escaping mechanisms provided by the `subprocess` library.

*   **Package Management:**
    *   **`apt` Library (Python) or `subprocess` with `apt-get`:**
        *   **Package Installation:** Use `apt.DebianPackageManager().install([package_name])` (if using `apt` library) or `subprocess.run(['sudo', 'apt-get', 'install', package_name])` (for `apt-get`).  **`sudo` is necessary for package installation and requires careful consideration in a controlled environment.**
        *   **Package Updates:** Use `apt.DebianPackageManager().update()` and `apt.DebianPackageManager().upgrade()` (for `apt` library) or `subprocess.run(['sudo', 'apt-get', 'update'])` and `subprocess.run(['sudo', 'apt-get', 'upgrade'])` (for `apt-get`).

*   **File System Access for RAG and Learning:**
    *   **File Reading:** Use `os.path.join()` to construct file paths within the allowed access directories. Use `with open(file_path, 'r') as f:` to read file content.
    *   **File Type Handling:** Handle different file types for RAG and learning:
        *   **Text Files:** Read directly.
        *   **Code Files:**  Parse code (using language-specific parsing libraries) for code analysis and learning.
        *   **Documentation Files:** Parse documentation formats (PDF, HTML, Markdown) as needed.
    *   **Vector Embeddings for Host Files:** Generate vector embeddings for the content of files stored on the host file system and index them in the vector database for RAG.

*   **Service Status Checks:**
    *   **`systemctl` Command:** Use `subprocess.run(['systemctl', 'status', service_name], capture_output=True, text=True)` to get the status of system services.
    *   **Status Parsing:** Parse the output of `systemctl status` to determine service status (active, inactive, failed, etc.).

*   **Bash Command Execution (If absolutely necessary and with extreme caution - highly discouraged for arbitrary commands):**
    *   **`subprocess.run()` with Command Whitelisting and Sanitization:** If direct bash command execution is required (again, highly discouraged for general use), use `subprocess.run()` but **only for commands that are explicitly whitelisted and carefully sanitized.**  Avoid using `shell=True` in `subprocess.run()` as it increases security risks.  Pass commands and arguments as a list to `subprocess.run()`.

    ```python
    # Example Python - package installation using apt-get via subprocess (very basic example - error handling and security are crucial in real implementation)
    import subprocess

    def install_package(package_name):
        try:
            command = ['sudo', 'apt-get', 'install', package_name, '-y'] # -y to auto-confirm install (use with caution in production)
            process = subprocess.run(command, capture_output=True, text=True, check=True) # check=True raises exception on non-zero exit code
            print(f"Package '{package_name}' installed successfully.")
            print("Output:\n", process.stdout)
        except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
            print(f"Error installing package '{package_name}':")
            print("Error Output:\n", e.stderr)
        except FileNotFoundError:
            print("Error: apt-get command not found (not a Debian/Ubuntu system?).")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")

    # Example usage (use with caution and proper security measures):
    package_to_install = 'your-package-name' # Replace with package name
    install_package(package_to_install)
    ```

## Host-Device Communication Architecture

This section describes the communication architecture between the LLMCoder host server (Ubuntu server) and end-user devices (laptop, tablet, phone).

**Approach: Web GUI with REST APIs and WebSockets**

The preferred approach for host-device communication is a web-based GUI served from the Ubuntu server, with communication handled via REST APIs for general requests and WebSockets for real-time data streams. This approach maximizes cross-platform compatibility and accessibility.

**Components:**

1.  **Ubuntu Server (Host):**
    *   **Backend API (Python - FastAPI or Flask):**  Develop a backend API using Python frameworks like FastAPI or Flask.
        *   **REST API Endpoints:**  For general requests like:
            *   User authentication and authorization.
            *   Data retrieval (notes, to-do lists, calendar events, JIRA tickets, etc.).
            *   Task initiation (Playwright tasks, macro replay, document summarization, etc.).
            *   Configuration settings.
        *   **WebSocket Server (using libraries like `websockets` or framework support):** For real-time communication:
            *   Streaming screen, audio, and key capture data from device to server.
            *   Sending real-time suggestions and feedback from server to device (e.g., code suggestions, error detection, "Turbo Mode" contributions).

    *   **LLM Processing and Agent Logic:**  All LLM-based processing, agent logic, data storage, and background tasks reside on the Ubuntu server.

2.  **End-User Device (Client - Web Browser):**
    *   **React-Based Web GUI:** Develop the user interface using React.
        *   **UI Components:** Components for code editor, note-taking, to-do lists, calendar display, JIRA ticket management, macro recording/replay, smart home control, etc.
        *   **REST API Communication (using `fetch` API or `axios` library):** For making requests to the backend REST API endpoints for data and actions.
        *   **WebSocket Client (using `socket.io-client` or native WebSocket API):** For establishing and maintaining WebSocket connections with the server for real-time data exchange.
        *   **State Management (React Context, Redux, Zustand):** For managing UI state and data flow within the React application.
        *   **UI Framework (Material UI, Ant Design, Chakra UI):** For pre-built UI components and styling.

**Communication Flow:**

1.  **Initial Load and Authentication:**
    *   User accesses the LLMCoder web GUI in their browser (e.g., `http://your-server-ip:port`).
    *   React frontend loads.
    *   User authentication (e.g., username/password, OAuth) via REST API calls to the backend.
    *   Backend authenticates user and returns session token or sets cookies.

2.  **General Data Retrieval and Actions (REST APIs):**
    *   Web GUI makes REST API requests to the backend to:
        *   Fetch initial data (notes, to-do lists, calendar events, etc.).
        *   Save changes to data.
        *   Initiate tasks (e.g., start Playwright task, trigger macro replay, request document summarization).
    *   Backend processes requests, interacts with databases, LLMs, and external APIs as needed.
    *   Backend returns data or status responses to the web GUI via REST API responses (JSON format).

3.  **Real-time Data Streaming (WebSockets):**
    *   When real-time features are activated (e.g., "Turbo Mode," code editor with real-time suggestions, screen/audio capture):
        *   React frontend establishes a WebSocket connection to the backend WebSocket server.
        *   **Device to Host (Client to Server):**
            *   For screen/audio/key capture: Client-side JavaScript code captures data and streams it to the server via the WebSocket connection.
            *   For code editor activity: Client-side code in the code editor monitors user input and sends code changes to the server via WebSocket.
        *   **Host to Device (Server to Client):**
            *   Backend LLM processing generates real-time suggestions, error detections, "Turbo Mode" contributions.
            *   Backend sends these real-time updates to the web GUI client via the WebSocket connection.
            *   React frontend updates the UI in real-time to display suggestions, errors, and other dynamic content.

**Example Code Snippets (Conceptual):**

*   **React Frontend - WebSocket Connection (using `socket.io-client` example):**

    ```javascript
    import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
    import io from 'socket.io-client';

    function RealtimeComponent() {
        const [message, setMessage] = useState('');
        const [socket, setSocket] = useState(null);

        useEffect(() => {
            const newSocket = io('http://your-server-ip:port'); // Connect to WebSocket server
            setSocket(newSocket);

            newSocket.on('realtime_update', (data) => { // Listen for 'realtime_update' events
                setMessage(data.content); // Update UI with received data
            });

            return () => { // Cleanup on unmount
                newSocket.disconnect();
            };
        }, []);

        const sendMessage = () => {
            if (socket) {
                socket.emit('send_message', { message: 'Hello from client' }); // Send message to server
            }
        };

        return (
            <div>
                <p>Realtime Message: {message}</p>
                <button onClick={sendMessage}>Send Message</button>
            </div>
        );
    }

    export default RealtimeComponent;
    ```

*   **Python Backend (FastAPI example with WebSockets):**

    ```python
    from fastapi import FastAPI, WebSocket
    from fastapi.websockets import WebSocketDisconnect

    app = FastAPI()

    @app.websocket("/ws") # WebSocket endpoint
    async def websocket_endpoint(websocket: WebSocket):
        await websocket.accept()
        try:
            while True:
                data = await websocket.receive_text() # Receive message from client
                print(f"Received: {data}")
                await websocket.send_text(f"Server received: {data}") # Send message back to client
                # Example: Send realtime update to client
                await websocket.send_json({"event": "realtime_update", "content": "Realtime data from server"})
        except WebSocketDisconnect:
            print("Client disconnected")

    # ... (REST API endpoints for other features) ...
    ```

**Advantages of Web GUI + REST + WebSockets:**

*   **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Works on any device with a web browser (laptop, tablet, phone, any OS).
*   **Accessibility:** No need to install a dedicated application on the client device.
*   **Centralized Logic:** All core logic and data management on the server (Ubuntu server).
*   **Real-time Capabilities:** WebSockets enable efficient real-time data streaming for interactive features.
*   **Scalability:** Backend server can be scaled independently of client devices.
