### 21. Host - Device Communication Architecture

**Overview:**  Describe the communication architecture between the host server (Ubuntu) and remote devices (laptops, mobile) for LLMCoder features.

**Architecture Choices:**

*   **Web GUI as Primary Interface:**  A React-based Web GUI served from the Ubuntu host is the primary interface for user interaction across devices. This ensures cross-platform compatibility (laptops, tablets, phones) without requiring native applications on each device.
*   **Backend on Ubuntu Host (Python):** The core backend logic, including LLMs, data processing, API integrations, and task scheduling, runs on the Ubuntu server. This centralizes compute resources and data management.
*   **Communication Protocol: REST APIs and WebSockets:**
    *   **REST APIs (HTTP):** For request-response type interactions, such as:
        *   Fetching initial UI data (dashboard, settings, project lists).
        *   Submitting user actions (creating notes, setting reminders, triggering tasks).
        *   Retrieving processed data (drafted emails, RAG answers, generated reports).
    *   **WebSockets:** For real-time, bi-directional communication, essential for features like:
        *   Real-time updates in the Web GUI (e.g., Slack messages, JIRA ticket updates).
        *   Streaming data from device to host (e.g., screen capture, audio stream for "Turbo Mode").
        *   Push notifications from host to device (e.g., reminders, task completion alerts).

**React Web GUI Packages (Example Stack):**

*   **`react`:** Core React library for UI components.
*   **`react-router-dom`:** For client-side routing within the Web GUI.
*   **`axios` or `fetch`:** For making HTTP requests to the backend REST APIs.
*   **`websocket` (JavaScript WebSocket API or libraries like `reconnecting-websocket` for robustness):** For WebSocket communication with the backend.
*   **State Management (e.g., `react-context`, `redux`, `zustand`):** To manage application state in the React frontend (UI state, user data, etc.).
*   **UI Component Library (e.g., `Material UI`, `Ant Design`, `Chakra UI`):** To accelerate UI development with pre-built components and consistent styling.
*   **Form Handling Libraries (e.g., `react-hook-form`, `formik`):** To simplify form management in React.
*   **Data Visualization Libraries (e.g., `Chart.js`, `react-chartjs-2`, `recharts`):** For displaying charts and graphs in the Web GUI.

**Device-Side Scripts/Applications (Optional - for specific features):**

*   **Python Scripts (for devices like laptops):** For features requiring local device access or OS-level operations, such as:
    *   Screen capture, audio capture, key capture (for "Turbo Mode").
    *   Playwright execution (for Playwright Integration and Intelligent Macros - especially for complex tasks or VM offloading).
    *   Potentially local LLM inference if desired for latency reasons in specific features (although centralizing on the Ubuntu host is generally preferred).
*   **Communication with Host:** Device-side scripts would communicate with the Ubuntu host backend primarily using WebSockets for real-time data streaming and control commands, and potentially REST APIs for initial setup or less frequent communication.

**Communication Flow Examples:**

*   **Fetching User Dashboard:**
    1.  Web GUI (React) on device sends an HTTP GET request to `/api/dashboard` endpoint on the Ubuntu host.
    2.  Ubuntu host backend processes the request, retrieves dashboard data from the database, and responds with JSON data.
    3.  Web GUI receives the JSON response and updates the UI to display the dashboard.

*   **Real-time Slack Message Updates:**
    1.  Web GUI establishes a WebSocket connection to `/ws/slack-updates` endpoint on the Ubuntu host.
    2.  Ubuntu host backend, when receiving new Slack messages via Slack API, pushes message data over the WebSocket connection to connected Web GUI clients.
    3.  Web GUI receives message data over WebSocket and updates the Slack message panel in real-time.

*   **"Turbo Mode" Screen Streaming:**
    1.  User activates "Turbo Mode" in the Web GUI.
    2.  Web GUI sends an HTTP request to `/api/turbo-mode/start` to the Ubuntu host to initiate "Turbo Mode" session.
    3.  Device-side Python script (running on laptop) starts capturing screen frames and audio.
    4.  Device-side script establishes a WebSocket connection to `/ws/turbo-mode-stream` on the Ubuntu host.
    5.  Device-side script streams captured screen frames and audio data over the WebSocket connection to the Ubuntu host.
    6.  Ubuntu host backend receives the stream, processes it (e.g., sends to LLM for analysis), and potentially sends responses back to the Web GUI over another WebSocket connection or REST API.

**Security Considerations for Host-Device Communication:**

*   **HTTPS for REST APIs:** Use HTTPS for all REST API communication to encrypt data in transit.
*   **WebSocket Security (WSS):** Use WSS (WebSocket Secure) for WebSocket connections to encrypt WebSocket traffic.
*   **Authentication and Authorization:** Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms for both REST APIs and WebSocket connections to ensure only authorized users and devices can access and interact with the backend.  JWT (JSON Web Tokens) are a common approach for API authentication.
*   **Secure WebSocket Handshake:**  Ensure proper WebSocket handshake and origin validation to prevent unauthorized connections.
*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Validate and sanitize all data received from devices (via REST APIs and WebSockets) on the Ubuntu host backend to prevent security vulnerabilities (e.g., injection attacks).
*   **Rate Limiting and DDoS Protection:** Implement rate limiting and DDoS protection measures on the Ubuntu host to prevent abuse and ensure system availability.

This comprehensive technical document outlines the detailed implementation strategies for each of the 20 productivity features and the host-device communication architecture for LLMCoder. This should serve as a solid foundation for development and roadmap planning. Please let me know if you have any further questions or require more detail on any specific aspect.
